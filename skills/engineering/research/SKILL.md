description: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a Markdown file in the repo. Use when the user wants a topic researched, docs or API facts gathered, or reading legwork delegated to a background agent.
---

Spin up a **background agent** to do the research, so you keep working while it reads.

Its job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** (official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs), not a secondary write-up of them. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write the findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save it to `docs/research/<yyyyMMdd>-<slug>.md`, creating the directory if needed and using the local creation date. If that name already exists, append `-2`, `-3`, and so on rather than overwriting it. Keep one file per run and report the path.
